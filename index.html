        Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in southern England.
        He graduated at King's College, Cambridge, with a degree in mathematics.
        Whilst he was a fellow at Cambridge, he published a proof demonstrating that
        some purely mathematical yesâ€“no questions can never be answered by computation
        and defined a Turing machine, and went on to prove the halting problem for
        Turing machines is undecidable. In 1938, he obtained his PhD from the
        Department of Mathematics at Princeton University. During the Second World War,
        Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley
        Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a
        time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval
        cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the
        breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish
        bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for
        the Enigma machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted 
        coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many
        crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic.
